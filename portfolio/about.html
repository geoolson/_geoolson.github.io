        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a senior Undergraduate at PSU studying Computer Science. Before studying computer science I was a professional Automotive Technician. As a Technician
            I enjoyed diagnosing the electronics and electrical systems in vehicles. I began venturing out and became a hobbyist embedded programmer. After a while I
            decided it was time to switch careers. My first year at PSU I studied Computer Engineering. I became more interested in the programming and switched
            to computer science. At PSU I'm also a member and former Vice President of the Viking Robotics Society. I've worked on several robotics projects while I participated
            in the club. I now intern for a manufacturer of network switches. I do full-stack web development and test automation. I work with Python, PHP, and Javascript at my
            internship.
