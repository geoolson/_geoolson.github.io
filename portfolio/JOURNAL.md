I'm looking into using PHP for building html templates so I can reduce the redundant html. PHP also runs on the Linux environment on the PSU linux accounts and is easy to deploy in our public_html directories. However, I'm developing on a Windows machine. I could ssh into the linux environment, and work remotely that way. However, I do prefer the benefits of the live server running locally showing results of my changes instantly in my browser. I think for now I'm going to shelve using PHP and stick with html and Javascript for this project.

I will probably deploy the finished site in my public_html directory at school still.

I've added a header and a background image to my header. I ran into a challenge with applying a filter over it. I found a solution where I apply another element over it and apply a background color and opacity to get the effect I was looking for.

I've added a navigation bar, css and a black background. I've also changed the background to a light grey. The links are not function yet. I've also added a media query so the links are all in one column when the screen shrinks.

Besides that, I'm running into issues with deploying the site on the linux account. For some reason the site can't fetch the background image. If this doesn't work out I may end up hosting this on github.

I'm sitll trying to figure out how I want to handle the navigation of the projects. I'm thinking of adding a dropdown menu for selecting a project or just having a single page of all my projects.

Dear Journal,

I've added a contact page. It doesn't have the form yet, but I've added links to social media and my email. I'm using font-awesome for some nice fonts for the links.

I've added an About Me page. The portfolio is starting to look more presentable. I think I'm going to have to use github for hosting this portfolio. I've been resisting because I have a past project already hosted. I'll have to look into what my option are. I would like to still host that past project.

Struggling with some of the styling for this dropdown menu I'm working on.

working now. All I need to do is add some project pages. This won't require any additional css or html. Just writing up some content

## 8:26

Finished the contact form. Deploying the site to github. I had to take down the project I'm hosting on it and add it to this repo as its own separate page.
